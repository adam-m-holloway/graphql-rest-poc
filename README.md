# GraphQL REST Proof of Concept

## Install and run
 - Install - `npm i`
 - Run REST API with `npm run rest`
 - Run GraphQL with `npm run gql`

Note: both the REST and GraphQL scripts need to be ran at the same time but in separate terminal windows.

## URLs
 - REST API - http://localhost:3000
 - GraphQL - http://localhost:4000 (GraphQL Playground)

For more information on RESTful endpoint and GraphQL queries/mutations/subscriptions please see the `README.md` inside the subfolders.
